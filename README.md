1. Predicted housing prices in Calfornia and allowed users to have a better insight by visualizing them on a map.  
2. Applied several **regression models** such as <code>KNN</code> , <code>SVM</code> , <code>Random Forest</code>, and <code>XGBoost</code>.  
3. Were able to improve the model's ability to predict by using a **stratifed k-fold cross validation**.


The dataset is obtained from Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices.
